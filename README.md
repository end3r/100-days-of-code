# My 100 Days of Code

I've started the **#100DaysOfCode** challenge on April 15th 2019, although I'm gonna bend the rules a bit to my needs - you can read the [initial blog post](https://dev.end3r.com/2019/04/my-100-days-of-code/) about my plans to learn about the details.

## Day 1: April 15th 2019

**Time spent**: 1h

**Today's Progress**: started with the [Enclave Phaser Template](https://github.com/EnclaveGames/Enclave-Phaser-Template), looked at a few Phaser 3 boilerplates.

**Thoughts:** well, right now I'm at the "I have no idea what I'm doing" stage with Phaser 3 as I haven't checked a single tutorial about it (yet), so "working on EPT" will be equal to "learning Phaser 3". It will take some time before I'll be able to publish something, but hey, at least I've finally started!

## Day 2: April 16th 2019

**Time spent**: 1h

**Today's Progress**: same as yesterday, plus thinking whether I should start incorporating the new syntax into the current template, or start from scratch.

**Thoughts:** wanted to spend more than 1 hour today, but I had to send a bunch of emails around our upcoming [Gamedev.js Warsaw](https://gamedevjs.pl/) meetup. I hope to speed up things tomorrow.

## Day 3: April 17th 2019

**Time spent**: 1h 30min

**Today's Progress**: took the time to research some of the other templates out there, tried upgrading the [EPT](https://github.com/EnclaveGames/Enclave-Phaser-Template)'s source code 1:1, but decided it needs to be rewritten from scratch.

**Thoughts:** I have no idea what I'm doing.

## Day 4: April 18th 2019

**Time spent**: 2h

**Today's Progress**: prepared and announced Piotr as the speaker for the [upcoming Gamedev.js Warsaw meetup](https://gamedevjs.pl/wydarzenia/warszawa-meetup-11). Also, updated the [js13kGames website](https://2019.js13kgames.com/) by moving 2018 content to its subdomain and the main page reflecting upcoming 2019 one.

**Thoughts:** I do hope I can count updating .yaml files on one website and fiddling with .php and .html ones on another.

## Day 5: April 19th 2019

**Time spent**: 1h

**Today's Progress**: did some client work, tried fixing a bug, but failed miserably. Will try next week again.

**Thoughts:** it's probably a typo, or not even a game's fault. Needs hours to find, probably 30 seconds to fix.

## Day 6: May 20th 2019

**Time spent**: 2h

**Today's Progress**: Started rewriting the [Enclave Phaser Template](https://github.com/EnclaveGames/Enclave-Phaser-Template) to Phaser 3: changing States to Scenes and moving the contents accordingly.

**Thoughts:** I had a **month-long** break after just the first week. National holidays, preparations for the [Gamedev.js Warsaw](https://gamedevjs.pl/) meetup, more holidays, preparations for the [js13kGames](https://js13kgames.com/) competition, catching up on a whole lot of emails, etc. At least I can cheat and don't need to start from day one again...

## Day 7: May 21st 2019

**Time spent**: 4h

**Today's Progress**: Rewriting [EPT](https://github.com/EnclaveGames/Enclave-Phaser-Template)'s buttons logic into the new syntax where there are no buttons, only images which you can set as interactive and define specific frames on various pointer events. Scrapped everything and created my own Button class to make them work almost exactly the same as in Phaser 2.

**Thoughts:** There are no buttons in Phaser 3! :O

## Day 8: May 22nd 2019

**Time spent**: 5h

**Today's Progress**: [EPT](https://github.com/EnclaveGames/Enclave-Phaser-Template): bugfixing issues with buttons, then some solid work on rewriting Storage, Language, Sounds, and creating the Settings page.

**Thoughts:** Still a lot of work, but I'm happy I can focus on a single project and simply dive into coding. I really missed that.

## Day 9: May 23rd 2019

**Time spent**: 1h

**Today's Progress**: EPT, updating the contents of the Settings page.

**Thoughts:** Not much, as today's the day of the [Gamedev.js Warsaw #12](https://gamedevjs.pl/wydarzenia/warszawa-meetup-12) meetup.

## Day 10: May 24th 2019

**Time spent**: 1h

**Today's Progress**: EPT, tidying up the utility functions.

**Thoughts:** Not much again, because Friday.

## Day 11: May 27th 2019

**Time spent**: 1h

**Today's Progress**: I wasted one hour trying to install some wildcard Let's Encrypt certs on the server.

**Thoughts:** I feel super dumb.

## Day 12: May 28th 2019

**Time spent**: TBD

**Today's Progress**: TBD

**Thoughts:** TBD
