# My 100 Days of Code

I've started the **#100DaysOfCode** challenge on April 15th 2019, although I'm gonna bend the rules a bit to my needs - you can read the [initial blog post](https://dev.end3r.com/2019/04/my-100-days-of-code/) about my plans to learn about the details.

## Day 1: April 15th 2019

**Time spent**: 1h

**Today's Progress**: started with the [Enclave Phaser Template](https://github.com/EnclaveGames/Enclave-Phaser-Template), looked at a few Phaser 3 boilerplates.

**Thoughts:** well, right now I'm at the "I have no idea what I'm doing" stage with Phaser 3 as I haven't checked a single tutorial about it (yet), so "working on EPT" will be equal to "learning Phaser 3". It will take some time before I'll be able to publish something, but hey, at least I've finally started!

## Day 2: April 16th 2019

**Time spent**: 1h

**Today's Progress**: same as yesterday, plus thinking whether I should start incorporating the new syntax into the current template, or start from scratch.

**Thoughts:** wanted to spend more than 1 hour today, but I had to send a bunch of emails around our upcoming [Gamedev.js Warsaw](https://gamedevjs.pl/) meetup. I hope to speed up things tomorrow.

## Day 3: April 17th 2019

**Time spent**: 1h 30min

**Today's Progress**: took the time to research some of the other templates out there, tried upgrading the [EPT](https://github.com/EnclaveGames/Enclave-Phaser-Template)'s source code 1:1, but decided it needs to be rewritten from scratch.

**Thoughts:** I have no idea what I'm doing.

## Day 4: April 18th 2019

**Time spent**: 2h

**Today's Progress**: prepared and announced Piotr as the speaker for the [upcoming Gamedev.js Warsaw meetup](https://gamedevjs.pl/wydarzenia/warszawa-meetup-11). Also, updated the [js13kGames website](https://2019.js13kgames.com/) by moving 2018 content to its subdomain and the main page reflecting upcoming 2019 one.

**Thoughts:** I do hope I can count updating .yaml files on one website and fiddling with .php and .html ones on another.

## Day 5: April 19th 2019

**Time spent**: 1h

**Today's Progress**: did some client work, tried fixing a bug, but failed miserably. Will try next week again.

**Thoughts:** it's probably a typo, or not even a game's fault. Needs hours to find, probably 30 seconds to fix.

## Day 6: May 20th 2019

**Time spent**: 2h

**Today's Progress**: Started rewriting the [Enclave Phaser Template](https://github.com/EnclaveGames/Enclave-Phaser-Template) to Phaser 3: changing States to Scenes and moving the contents accordingly.

**Thoughts:** I had a **month-long** break after just the first week. National holidays, preparations for the [Gamedev.js Warsaw](https://gamedevjs.pl/) meetup, more holidays, preparations for the [js13kGames](https://js13kgames.com/) competition, catching up on a whole lot of emails, etc. At least I can cheat and don't need to start from day one again...

## Day 7: May 21st 2019

**Time spent**: 4h

**Today's Progress**: Rewriting [EPT](https://github.com/EnclaveGames/Enclave-Phaser-Template)'s buttons logic into the new syntax where there are no buttons, only images which you can set as interactive and define specific frames on various pointer events. Scrapped everything and created my own Button class to make them work almost exactly the same as in Phaser 2.

**Thoughts:** There are no buttons in Phaser 3! :O

## Day 8: May 22nd 2019

**Time spent**: 5h

**Today's Progress**: [EPT](https://github.com/EnclaveGames/Enclave-Phaser-Template): bugfixing issues with buttons, then some solid work on rewriting Storage, Language, Sounds, and creating the Settings page.

**Thoughts:** Still a lot of work, but I'm happy I can focus on a single project and simply dive into coding. I really missed that.

## Day 9: May 23rd 2019

**Time spent**: 1h

**Today's Progress**: [EPT](https://github.com/EnclaveGames/Enclave-Phaser-Template), updating the contents of the Settings page.

**Thoughts:** Not much, as today's the day of the [Gamedev.js Warsaw #12](https://gamedevjs.pl/wydarzenia/warszawa-meetup-12) meetup.

## Day 10: May 24th 2019

**Time spent**: 1h

**Today's Progress**: [EPT](https://github.com/EnclaveGames/Enclave-Phaser-Template), tidying up the utility functions.

**Thoughts:** Not much again, because Friday.

## Day 11: May 27th 2019

**Time spent**: 1h

**Today's Progress**: I wasted one hour trying to install some wildcard Let's Encrypt certs on the server.

**Thoughts:** I feel super dumb.

## Day 12: May 28th 2019

**Time spent**: 1h

**Today's Progress**: [EPT](https://github.com/EnclaveGames/Enclave-Phaser-Template): tinkering with the audio functions.

**Thoughts:** Those definitely need some rewriting.

## Day 13: May 29th 2019

**Time spent**: 1h

**Today's Progress**: [EPT](https://github.com/EnclaveGames/Enclave-Phaser-Template): changed the audio functions so they work with sound and music independently, but using one function for both.

**Thoughts:** taken from Flood Escape where you can turn the sounds/music on/off in the settings while in previous games it was a single button for both on the main menu screen.

## Day 14: May 30th 2019

**Time spent**: 1h

**Today's Progress**: [EPT](https://github.com/EnclaveGames/Enclave-Phaser-Template): updating Settings and Credits.

**Thoughts:** It's starting to look like something usable again.

## Day 15: May 31st 2019

**Time spent**: 1h

**Today's Progress**: [EPT](https://github.com/EnclaveGames/Enclave-Phaser-Template): (re)adding tweens to all the buttons, to make them look cool again.

**Thoughts:** It needed a bit of research on the new syntax, but it's not that different from v2.

## Day 16: June 3rd 2019

**Time spent**: 1h

**Today's Progress**: Started working on our [Meditations](https://dev.end3r.com/2019/06/meditations-games-june-30th/) project - stumbled upon trivial stuff like how do you attach a sprite to the cursor.

**Thoughts:** We had something, and now I decided to shift from Phaser 2 to Phaser 3, and so our little project will be a learning curve. Wanted to complete it when I finish EPT, but the time was running out and Meditations had to be finished as soon as possible.

## Day 17: June 4th 2019

**Time spent**: 3h

**Today's Progress**: [Meditations](https://dev.end3r.com/2019/06/meditations-games-june-30th/): today I learned how to properly initialize a pool of objects.

**Thoughts:** It's a little bit different than in Phaser 2. Plus last time I did it in Phaser 2 was two years ago.

## Day 18: June 5th 2019

**Time spent**: 12h

**Today's Progress**: [Meditations](https://dev.end3r.com/2019/06/meditations-games-june-30th/): the whole demo was created today, and a bunch of bugs fixed.

**Thoughts:** Yup, 12 hours - would be three times shorter if I hadn't research every single line I wanted to write. It was a long and exhausting day, but nonetheless productive.

## Day 19: June 6th 2019

**Time spent**: 3h

**Today's Progress**: [Meditations](https://dev.end3r.com/2019/06/meditations-games-june-30th/): base64-ing all the images, and packing everything into a single html file. Of course I had to have a bunch of bugs in the process.

**Thoughts:** Was expecting this will take 30 minutes tops, but at least it was finished today.

## Day 20: June 7th 2019

**Time spent**: 1h

**Today's Progress**: Did some API adjustments for a client that owns a few of our games.

**Thoughts:** Nothing fancy, but the work that needs to be done.

## Day 21: July 15th 2019

**Time spent**: 3h

**Today's Progress**: [EPT](https://github.com/EnclaveGames/Enclave-Phaser-Template): making gameplay of clicking on the dummy button work again in Game.js.

**Thoughts:** Another "short break" that took a month, eh. There's too much non-coding work to be done around js13kGames, preparing talks for conferences, and such.

## Day 22: July 16th 2019

**Time spent**: 4h

**Today's Progress**: [EPT](https://github.com/EnclaveGames/Enclave-Phaser-Template): main menu layout, new buttons, tweens, screen shake, particle effects.

**Thoughts:** I really enjoy coding, if only I didn't have all those emails I'm suppose to reply in the back of my head.

## Day 23: July 17th 2019

**Time spent**: 5h

**Today's Progress**: [EPT](https://github.com/EnclaveGames/Enclave-Phaser-Template): settings and credits pages, adding webfonts, keyboard controls and page with all the shortcuts, localization in two languages.

**Thoughts:** Now I'm really feeling that "it's almost ready" feel. Only minor fixes, some cleaning, and it should be ready by the end of this week. Yay!

## Day 24: July 18th 2019

**Time spent**: 1h

**Today's Progress**: [EPT](https://github.com/EnclaveGames/Enclave-Phaser-Template): added Web Monetization and did some cleaning in the source code.

**Thoughts:** Still some finishing touches needed, but it looks good already.

## Day 25: July 19th 2019

**Time spent**: 1h

**Today's Progress**: [EPT](https://github.com/EnclaveGames/Enclave-Phaser-Template): removing comments, optimizing functions.

**Thoughts:** It's almost ready.

## Day 26: July 22nd 2019

**Time spent**: 2h

**Today's Progress**: [EPT](https://github.com/EnclaveGames/Enclave-Phaser-Template): final tweaks and updates, and that's it, today's the day: [Enclave Phaser Template updated to Phaser 3](https://dev.end3r.com/2019/07/enclave-phaser-template-updated-to-phaser-3/)!

**Thoughts:** Yay! Now onto the actual games built with it.

## Day 27: July 23rd 2019

**Time spent**: TBD

**Today's Progress**: TBD

**Thoughts:** TBD
